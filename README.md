# AWS Route 53 Automated Dynamic DNS 
##### Using CloudWatch Event EC2 Notification triggering Lambda function to automatically update Private IP address as an A record to Route 53 Private Zone, also using DynamoDB to store the information.
##### The Name Tags is using to identify the hostname of the server
##### I am not a pure DEV so please don't be angry with me for Python code stuff :P
![Admin](./picture/1.png)
## The solution 
1. Creating Infrastruture using Terraform: Route 53 Private Zone, CloudWatch Event, Lambda function, DynamoDB.
2. Using CloudWatch Event EC2 Notification - Running triggering Lambda function to update Private IP address as an A record to Route 53 Private Zone, also update to DynamoDB record.
3. Using CloudWatch Event EC2 Notification - Terminated triggering Lambda function to remove Private IP address from Route 53 Private Hosted Zone, also remove to DynamoDB record.

## Details
#### You must have local host or any host with terraform and AWS CLI installed.
1. Configure AWS credentials
```
aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [****************WWVC]:

```
2. Check VPC ID in your AWS account and edit it in main.tfvars
```
#Environment
region = "us-east-1"
environment = "dev"

##Route 53
private_hosted_zone_name = "dev.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.cloud"  --> Change your Route 53 private hosted zone name here
vpc_id = "vpc-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" --> Change your VPC ID here
record_type = "A"

#Lambda variables
lambda_name = "Dynamic_DNS_update"
python_filename = "DNS_update.zip"
handler_name = "DNS_update.lambda_handler"
lambda_timeout = 60
lambda_memory_size = 512
```
3. Terraform init
```
terraform init
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Installing hashicorp/aws v3.45.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v3.45.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```
3. Terraform plan
```
$ terraform.exe plan -var-file=main.tfvars

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

![Admin](./picture/3.png)
6. Check the Route 53 A record is available in Privated Host Zone with hostname = Tags.Name, value = Private IP address
#####
![Admin](./picture/4.PNG)
7. Terminate EC2 instance with Tags Key = Name, Value = 
#####
8. Check the Route 53 A record is removed in Privated Host Zone
##### Note: You can modify the code for support CNAME tagging/ CNAME Route 53
##### Only EC2 which is crated/terminated after Lambda function creation takes into effect. Available EC2 needs stop/start or another solution (in developing) to update the record.
